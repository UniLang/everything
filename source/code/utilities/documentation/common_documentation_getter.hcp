//This was common documentation I was adding to every software manual.
//This way of installing debs worked somewhat for me.  
//It got the sfotware installed, but it had some other issues when re-installing or trying to remove.
//And when I did install from the deb it seemed to have a ton of repeated information.
//Maybe there is a better way to host debs and explain how to install them.
