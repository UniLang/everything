REAPI meeting (10/13/2020): 
mostly questions & implementations about v3 (we are on v2)
bytestream compression: should the client's offset point to compressed/uncompressed data?
many opinions; no resolution. throw away bytestream in the future for better semantics?
platforms: let's move them from the command to the action instead; it will save a blob download.
Platforms are also getting too big.  A different format might be needed in v3.
reapi protobuf: many tickets on build issues. particularly go bindings.
should we commit the go bindings pre-generated, or drop support? drop.
reapi CI: There is still no CI.  someone should add that.
bazelcon: no remex talks this year.

REAPI meeting (11/10/2020): 
Goma implementation is going away.
platform now moved to action.
New platform lexicon added to actions (risc).
discussion on how to version in the future:
Service organization could have been better to make capability support more granular.
Maybe this will be done for v3.  Bazel decided not to split into services, but this can be revisited.
operation consolidation: do we need a proto flag for this? merging actions can be an implementation detail and leverage skip_cache.
do we need a proto flag for guaranteeing an action only runs once?  Not unless someone comes up with a good use case.  
We will document that any action has the potential to run more than once given any execution request.
