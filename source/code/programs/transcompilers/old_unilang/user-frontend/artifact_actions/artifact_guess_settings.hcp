    // what kind of artifacts do you want to build under particular conditions?
    // its a little weird that we have all these little permutations of decision making(for artifact generation) as separate containers to be populated.
    // each of these basically correlate to an if statement.
    // its also not clear whether we can be precise like this, because you may want to only have a kind of artifact,
    // if other conditions were not met.  Either way, I would like to try and formalize all of these decisions into a data format.  
    // even if it seems a bit obtuse to do that, it will make all the settings per exporter consistent.  We can make this more complicated
    // over time based on how those other situations arise.  Either way, what we have here supports
    // the use-cases of writing unilang code, and automatically deriving the right artifacts based on the company.
    // we can try to make this more clear about which ones take precedence over the others
