    //in a perfect world, I'd like a unit test to not involve any additional test dependencies.
    //why? because everything in the interface of a function/method would have to already be included at some point in the interface/implementation dependencies
    //the interface and implementation dependencies are automatically considered dependences of the test, because without them, we couldn't compile.
    //the base headers are traversed, and the tree is automatically a chunk of dependencies we would copy over to the test environment.  So the only time I could
    //see additional test dependencies needed, is for integration tests.  Type A is used to produce type B which is given to C under test.  So Type A is an additional
    //dependency.  type B is already derived based on the interface dependencies, as it must be making up the methods being tested.
    
    //I skimmed what I read above.  Whatever, sometimes you do need dependencies that are only in the tests.
    //So this makes sense regardless of if we think it will usually be empty.
