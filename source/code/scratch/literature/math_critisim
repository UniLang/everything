Basically, you have numbers. 1 2 3 etc. Then you have more numbers in between. 1.5, 2.75, 1.33.... etc.
Keep sprinkling more abstract bullshit and you end up with pure autism like π

How do you define all of the above such that it's not borderline schizophrenia and an actual definition that can be used as a foundation? You can't, but you can approximately define it by not taking your pills and deciding to cut the number line in two. That definition doesn't actually do anything but people pretend that it does because anti-conformism requires significantly more calories than just passive conformism.

So how is this acceptable? It's not, which is where the controversy comes from, and it's only a controversy because people adamantly refuse to address it.


>But instead of interpreting Cantor’s diagonal proof honestly, we take the proof to “show there are numbers bigger than the infinite”, which “sets the whole mind in a whirl, and gives the pleasant feeling of paradox” (LFM 16–17)—a “giddiness attacks us when we think of certain theorems in set theory”—“when we are performing a piece of logical sleight-of-hand” (PI §412; §426; 1945). This giddiness and pleasant feeling of paradox, says Wittgenstein (LFM 16), “may be the chief reason [set theory] was invented”.
