# Why does this docker container exist?
# I'd like to build everything from source, but that's not always easy.
# From Cmake to autotools; the world is full of exotic builds and difficult to pin-down dependencies.
# For non-bazel projects, I usually have to rewrite the tool's build files in skylark.
# This can be difficult.  For example, when build files generate other build files for the build, it can be too much work.
# We use the docker container when we can't figure out how to build certain projects.
# As an aspiration, I'd want to migrate as many package manager-related actions into the build rules.
# But if it's too hard, they can stay here.
# It's also nice to have Dockerfiles for CIs and containerized contexts for different tools.

# Other thoughts on reducing this Dockerfile:
# I think there is a way to include debian packages directly in bazel rules.  We could look into that.
# Although its a better practice to run all of these commands a a single command since it will create less layers,
# I'm keeping them separated as it makes debugging easier.

# We try to upgrade to the latest Ubuntu when available

# With the transition from Ubuntu 14.04 to 18.04, installing xorg would pause for user input on country
# This has been mitigated using the "noninteractive".
