This is where we write Unilang for external projects that do not have unilang tooling as part of their own build system.
We write a mirrored version of a repository here in UniLang, and then there is a transfer process.  
It converts UniLang to the company/community's repository.  

Clearly UniLang code will need to interact/reference non-UniLang code as well.  
This can become a gray area and a dead end for certain kinds of analysis.  
However, this lack of context is necessary when injecting UniLang artifacts into other code bases, and UniLang has language concepts to support this.  

What if somebody changes code that was generated by UniLang?  
Again, it can be a manual process of re-updating the UniLang code to ensure its generation matches the changes.  
Seeing these changes are usually for the better though, as it helps us adapt UniLang to the needs of others.
When Unilang is regenerated and changes were made, we can evaluate if these changes could have been prevented by better generation.

Summary:
The directories here mirror the Desktop directories of non-unilang codebases that exist either on or off the same machine.  
We write our unilang code in these directories and they are transcompiled and transferred onto the repo (possibly over the network).  
We do this because we want to keep the UniLang files in our codebase, and avoid generated artifacts staying in the repo.
